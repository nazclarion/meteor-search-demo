### Description

This is a single page application demo of Meteor reactive search capabilities. The application keeps the list of public RSS feeds. The news will be updated every minute from all the feeds.

A user may search the news  after adding text to an input field.  Search results may be filtered by news source or by tags. Both filters may be used together, "__Reset__" buttons discard all the selected fields in each filter independently. Searching and filtering will instantly update the search results list.
